# DataStructures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! 🎉

Here you will find various algorithms and data structures implemented in C++. These implementations are meant to serve as a reference for those learning about these concepts, or as a starting point for more advanced projects.

The following algorithms and data structures are currently included:

Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Quick sort
Searching algorithms: Linear search, Binary search
Data structures: Linked list, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph

We welcome contributions and suggestions for improvement! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any ideas. 🤝

Thank you for visiting and happy coding! 💻
